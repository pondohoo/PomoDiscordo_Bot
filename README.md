## Inspiration
As college students we like to procrastinate and put things to the last minute. Recent midterms has made this fact clear for many of us. PomoDiscordo is an enjoyable way to keep up on your work and study with friends through Discord.

## What it does
PomoDiscordo is a Discord bot implementation of the Pomodoro studying method (focusing on studying for set periods of time that have set break times at the end of each period). Users can start a Pomodoro timer by providing a length of the study period, length of the break period, and how many iterations of this they would like to study for, or by using the default values. Users may also cancel the timer at any time by using the corresponding command. All commands are displayed by typing in "!pom help".

## How we built it
We utilized Python and accessed the Discord API in order to complete this project

## Challenges we ran into
Our first experience with Discord bots was at 10 am this morning on Nate's Discord Bots workshop, so getting started was somewhat of a challenge. Authenticating our bot through the access token failed to work for a good while, which cut into our actual hacking time. Both of us also happen to be fairly new to Python, so there were some syntax struggles here and there as well. Much of what we had planned for the bot did not come into fruition because of these constraints.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the fact that the bot may have turned out fairly simple in the end, we are proud that we were able to bring out a finished, "functioning" product before the deadline. Our experiences today will carry us in our planning process for future hackathons.

## What we learned
Something that struck us both as a surprise is how much you could learn in just a single day. When put under a time pressure as well as working with a peer with similar goals, individuals are more motivated to try and learn something new. Working with another person also serves as a creative outlet as you can bounce ideas off each other. Most importantly, however, we learned how to Google.

## What's next for PomoDiscordo
The future of PomoDiscordo is going to be publicized to students. When studying, students could either go remote or online. While remote, students can use PomoDiscordo to study with their friends while being set under a balance of work and fun.
